# Example: psql_database_name = polydb

# this user should also have create table, modify table privileges in PostgreSQL database referred above
# Example: john

# Example: psql_database_password = my_password

# Apache user name, usually www-data. I need this info so I can transfer the privileges
# to the Apache user and then the web-front end can access PolyDB database
# Example: apache_user = www-data
apache_user = www-data

# Subdirectory of Apache HTDOCS directory where PolyDB home pages will reside
# Example: html_base = /var/www 
html_base = www

# Location of cgi-bin directory
# Leave it empty if cgi-bin can be internal to DocumentRoot (htdocs); 
# If cgi-bin directory is outside DocumentRoot (htdocs), provide here the full path, usually in /usr/lib/cgi-bin
# Example: cgibin_root = /usr/lib/cgi-bin

# Host
# Example: host = www.myhost.org
host = localhost

# URL of polydb web pages
# Example: url = www.myhost.org/polydb
url = localhost/polydb

# Directory containing the perl libraries
# If using local::libs to install libraries in the home directory

###############
# Dataset name
# This string identifies the dataset that will be uploaded in the database. 
#
# Recommended format: 
# . first letter of genus name followed b species name. No space between those. 
#
# Example: ecoli for Escherichia coli.
# . add a suffix, separated by underscore '_', identifying the samples being uploaded. 
#
# Examples:  
# In the case of vancomycin resistant and susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus: saureus_van
# In the case of complete vs nitrogen depleted cultures of Aspergillus nidulans : anidulans_nitro
#
# DONT'S:
# - Do not use dots '.'.  Restriction imposed to SQL table names
# - Do not use upper case. Restriction imposed to SQL table names. 
# It will be automatically converted to lower case by PostgreSQL.
# - Only use 16 characters at most. 
# Dataset with more than 16 characters will generate some issues when
# creating indexed fields names. Those names are going to be very large
# because they encompass the concatenation of the "dataset name" and 
# the "field name"
