	The data dump is a tab delimited file having the first line as a header<br><br>
	<b>Important:</b> We recommend MS-Excel as a viewer, but please verify if the data was imported correctly into Excel before starting the analysis. <br>
	MS-Excel converts numerical gene identifiers with many digits to floating point numbers. This will automatically round the supposedly number, what is highly undesirable for a gene identifier<br>
	This could be prevented by importing the data in Excel using the "Import Text File..." and explicitly
	assigning the gene identifier columns as text during the importing process. <BR><BR>
