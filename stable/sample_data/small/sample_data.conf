# Recommended format:
# . first letter of genus name + species name. No space between those.
# . add a suffix, separated by underscore '_', indicating the group of samples being uploaded.
# Example:  ecoli_shiga
#
# DONT'S:
# - Do not use dots '.'.  Restriction imposed to SQL table names
# - Do not use upper case. Restriction imposed to SQL table names.
# It will be automatically converted to lower case by Postgres.
# - Only use 16 characters at most.
# Dataset with more than 16 characters will generate some issues when
# creating indexed fields names. Those names are going to be very large

# the "field name"
