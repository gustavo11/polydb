###############
# Dataset name
# This string identifies the dataset that will be uploaded in the database. 
#
# Recommended format: 
# . first letter of genus name followed b species name. No space between those. 
#
# Example: ecoli for Escherichia coli.
# . add a suffix, separated by underscore '_', identifying the samples being uploaded. 
#
# Examples:  
# In the case of vancomycin resistant and susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus: saureus_van
# In the case of complete vs nitrogen depleted cultures of Aspergillus nidulans : anidulans_nitro
#
# DONT'S:
# - Do not use dots '.'.  Restriction imposed to SQL table names
# - Do not use upper case. Restriction imposed to SQL table names. 
# It will be automatically converted to lower case by PostgreSQL.
# - Only use 16 characters at most. 
# Dataset with more than 16 characters will generate some issues when
# creating indexed fields names. Those names are going to be very large
# because they encompass the concatenation of the "dataset name" and 
# the "field name"
