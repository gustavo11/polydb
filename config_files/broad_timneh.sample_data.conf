# Dataset name
# This string identifies the dataset be uploaded in the database 
# and by supporting scripts
#
# Recommended format: 
# . first letter of genus name + species name. No space between those.
# . add a suffix, separated by underscore '_', indicating the group of samples being uploaded. 
# Example:  saureus_fr_04
#
# DONT'S:
# - Do not use dots '.'.  Restriction imposed to SQL table names
# - Do not use upper case. Restriction imposed to SQL table names. 
# It will be automatically converted to lower case by Postgres.
# - Only use 16 characters at most. 
# Dataset with more than 16 characters will generate some issues when
# creating indexed fields names. Those names are going to be very large
# because they encompass the concatenation of the "dataset name" and 
# the "field name"
